- question: How long does the conversion process take?
  answer: Every publishers' files are unique. As a result, there is no way to generalize the time a conversion will take. A Conversion Plan is developed for each customer which defines stages and timelines in advance of any conversion. <br /> <br /> Prior to each conversion, we request a complete master file, full set of reports, and duplicates of output such as issue files, invoices, renewals, financials, and any other documents produced from a recent issue close. Once those documents are received, Computer Fullfilment produces full statistics and replicates all output from the conversion test file to ensure that the replicated output matches the sample issue documents prior to scheduling the actual conversion.
