						<h2>Business Solutions for Business Publishers</h2>

					</div>
					<p>If you're like most business publishers, your advertisers are looking for alternatives to print advertising and, in response, you've extended your brands to include additional online, offline, and in-person events to your portfolio of products.</p>

					<p>The result? Growing but increasingly disparate, multi-channel data silos with no real economies of scale. Circulation data is housed and managed in your audience development department. E-newsletter subscribers are the purview of editorial. And your online and offline event attendees are safeguarded by marketing.</p>

					<p>You need a flexible, integrated database management partner with real-world publishing expertise to help you respond to changing business needs in real-time with real-time data.</p>

					<p>Computer Fulfillment's end-to-end data solutions help publishers of any size expand their media view with online, real-time circulation & database management solutions and an expert support staff with real-world publishing experience.</p>
